2.) Comments:

To get familiar with the mraa library, I refer to the tutorial on https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B6dyEb8VXZo-N3hVcVI0UFpWSVk
To understand the design of this embedded application, I refer to the TA slides
To test my program, I run the executable with --log, supply different combinations of STDIN commands, shutdown either by OFF command or pressing the button. Then, I check each line of my logfile to make sure that the intervals between two time stamps are as expected.
