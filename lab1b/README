1. Description of included files

lab1b-client.c: a C source program that sends input from the keyboard to the socket (while echoing to the display), and input from the socket to the display
lab1b-server.c: a C source program that sends the client's commands to the shell and will serve the client outputs of shell
my.key: a txt file that contains the key for encryption
Makefile: a Makefile that supports three targets default, clean, and dist.

2. Encryption algorithm
   For --encrypt, I used the twofish algorithm with cfb mode
   For the encryption key, I used a 128 bit or 16 bytes key: hellohellohellohello
   For the initialization vector, I used a char array of '\0'

3. Reference source
   To understand socket functions, I refer to http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~moorthy/Courses/os98/Pgms/socket.html
   To understand the program at high level, I refer to TA slides on CCLE
