1. Description of included files

lab1a.c: a C source program that implements a character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal and passes input and output between two processes
	 Support --shell=program and --debug options.
Makefile: a Makefile that supports three targets default, clean, and dist.

2. Testing methodoly
   Since lab1a multiplexes inputs and outputs between the terminal and the shell, the testing is complicated.
   During the final poll, three normal shutdown process (EOF from terminal, EOF or pollerror from shell, receipt of SIGPIPE) 
   might occur at the same time and in a non-deterministic order. Therefore, we support a --debug feature that
   if one of these shutdown events occur, we logs a message to stderr such as "eof on stdin", "shell hangup", and "SIGPIPE received"
   Also, to tell if the program has recognized ^C and ^D from keyboard, we echo a caret and a capital letter to the screen instead of
   the original character.

3. Reference source
   To understand noncanonical mode and termnios functions, I refer to https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Noncanon-Example.html
   To understand the program at high level, I refer to TA slides on CCLE
